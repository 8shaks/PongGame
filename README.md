# Pong Game Website

This is a website dedicated to the game pong. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the Pong Game, and was made with the help of a tutorial from udemy, although I can't find the repo anymore.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be


Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/8shaks/PongGame.github.io.git`
`npm install`
`npm run start`

I suggest using the liver server extension with VS Code so we don't have to continuously reload the page after making changes to the code.
